        to develop and encourage take up of possible frameworks. Exhibit 8: Inclusive International Governance 23 Action
        Agenda
        Increased investment in digital foundations will help overcome access barriers, enhance data availability and
        increase
        citizen participation in financing decisions. Specific consideration of data access, usage and sharing in the
        design of
        robust digital foundations, will help mitigate data privacy and data monopolization risks. Advancing digital
        financing
        ecosystems will ease the development of relevant innovations, increasing citizen interest and agency. Regional
        approaches to these ecosystems will drive partnerships, knowledge exchange and support local talent development.
        Development of local regulatory and supervisory tools and capabilities, as part of advancing digital financing
        ecosystems, will address new risks such as algorithmic biases and unfair treatment. Advancing digital financing
        ecosystems will drive innovation that undermines rent-taking. International cooperation in inclusive governance
        and
        policy dialogue will help build regulatory capabilities and support innovation in digital financing.
        International
        cooperation in governance will help address risks such as data monopolization and advance solutions to systemic
        risks,
        such as cybersecurity, posed by large platforms through greater dialogue and information sharing on threats.
        Pursuing
        catalytic opportunities will result in increased innovation, disruption, disintermediation and transparency,
        potentially
        helping to overcome incumbent resistance. Pursuing catalytic opportunities will redirect significant financial
        flows
        towards long-term sustainable investments, away from shorttermism. It will also drive innovation that undermines
        rent-taking. Empowering citizens, individually and collectively, by advancing digital financial literacy
        programs,
        access to information, and increased transparency, including addressing barriers for specific groups such as
        women and
        older people, will drive greater usage of digital financial services and citizen involvement in financing
        decisions.
        Securing citizen rights and capabilities and ensuring adequate protection mechanisms will contribute to reducing
        fraud
        and building trust. Furthermore, this will strengthen citizensâ€™ role as accountability agents, which will
        contribute
        to curbing such risks as short-termism and volatility trading. Exhibit 9: Action Agenda Helps Overcome Barriers
        and
        Risks OVERCOMING BARRIERS ADDRESSING RISKS 24 Implementing the Task Forceâ€™s Action Agenda can close the gap in
        financing the SDGs. The Action Agenda sets out how digitalization can be harnessed to deliver the financing
        needed by
        investing in digital infrastructure, encouraging market development, empowering citizens and enabling the
        necessary
        governance innovations. Implementing the Action Agenda will undoubtedly be a challenge. The call is for systemic
        changes
        in finance, citizensâ€™ capabilities and the practice of institutional innovations. Digitalization and its
        disruptive
        effects open the way to this systemic change, if guided to overcome barriers, avoid risks, and seize SDG-aligned
        opportunities. The current health and economic crisis related to COVID-19 increases the challenge of addressing
        long-term needs. At the same time, its impact in accelerating all aspects of digitalization may ultimately make
        it
        easier to implement the Action Agenda. Every country can and should advance digitally enabled, citizen-centric
        financing
        of the SDGs. The Call to Action and Action Agenda are ambitious and achievable and are relevant to all
        countries.
        Specific aspects and focus areas, however, depend on national priorities, the maturity of digital
        infrastructure, public
        financing and financial markets, capabilities and financial governance arrangements. There is a sequencing
        dependent on
        a countryâ€™s stage of development: Less developed countries might focus on building affordable digital
        infrastructure,
        developing digital skills, providing secure digital IDs, and ensuring access to core financial services.
        Countries that
        have these foundations in place might place more emphasis on secure savings, SME borrowing and more transparent
        and
        efficient public finance and tax collection. Countries with significant pools of domestic savings might
        emphasize new
        channels for aggregating savings to be used for longer term sustainable development financing. Countries with
        sophisticated financial and capital markets might prioritize improved risk pricing, impact investing, and
        operationalizing the rights of shareholders and pension policyholders in shaping investment policies. Whilst the
        basic
        digital infrastructure needs to be in place, less developed countries can without doubt harness catalytic
        opportunities
        in leapfrogging to more sophisticated, impactful financing arrangements. For example, it is demonstrably
        possible to
        harness digitalization to connect domestic savings to infrastructure investment in the face of weak or absent
        capital
        markets, and leverage data from payment platforms to advance algorithmic lending to SMEs, or digital approaches
        to
        developing stock exchanges. Next Steps NEXT STEPS 25 Finally, the UN should develop a mechanism for stewarding
